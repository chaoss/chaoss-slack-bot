              <https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#chaoss>
              We spent some time to consolidate questions and answers for you. In response, we have made two very clear issues to demonstrate what we would like from you to help us better understand and gauge your interest. You can find them in the following issues:\n
              <https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues/312> (Conversion Rate)\n
              <https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues/311> (Documentation Inclusivity)`,
