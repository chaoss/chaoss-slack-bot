# CHAOSS SLACK BOT

## About

This holds the code to the CHAOSS slack bot for newcomers to the project.  Built with  [Bolt for JavaScript](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts). For an open source community to grow, supporting newcomers and providing them with the information they need to contribute is really important. CHAOSS Slack Bot aims to provide a solution to this problem. Thanks for checking us out!

## Bot Functions

- When a user joins the team, sends a message in a predefined channel asking them to introduce themselves.
- When a user joins the team, sends an interactive message via DM to determine how they intend to contribute and provide the relevant resources.
- When a user types “newbie” in a channel or to the bot directly, sends an interactive message showing ways you can contribute.
- When a user types “outreachy” in a channel or to the bot directly, responds with information about Outreachy.
- Responds when a user says "hello", "hey" or "hi".
- Can send a DM to all users in the workspace, triggered by the message “intro-CHAOSS”.
